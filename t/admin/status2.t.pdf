(                Remaining Habitat tasks \(7/23/86\))'
(                ---------------------------------)'
(        What follows is intended to be an exhaustive list of the remaining)'
(implementation tasks in the Habitat project.  They are listed in very rough)'
(order of priority, ranked in groups from most important to least important.)'
()'
(Generate the world --)'
(    Immense ongoing task to make the Habitat an interesting place to visit.)'
(        Priority: very high)'
(        Who: everyone)'
(        Time: open ended, needs planning for immediate next stages)'
(        Status: first piece of world is almost ready, various other pieces in)'
(                various other states of design/implementation.)'
(        Unresolved issues: File transfer to host for realm descriptions)'
(                remains a problem.)'
()'
(Teleport network --)'
(    Basic long-distance random-access transportation system.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Janet to implement teleport number lookup mechanism in host; Chip)'
(                and Randy to test and debug related object behaviors)'
(        Time: Janet estimates <1 day for lookup engine; 1 day for C64)'
(                integration.)'
(        Status: C64 components all work, though they haven't been tested in)'
(                concert as there is no way to do this; host object behaviors)'
(                are all written, but untested due to lack of number lookup)'
(                mechanism; everything awaits the teleport number database and)'
(                associated access routines)'
(        Unresolved issues: Quantum marketing has not recognized that portable)'
(                teleporters are not feasible, nor are they desirable)'
()'
(More heads --)'

(        Time: variable and ongoing)'
(        Status: 35 heads and counting)'

(                acceptable dimensions of avatar variability)'
()'
(Sex change device --)'
(    Aric has added sex to avatar torsos.  We need a device to let players)'
(    choose their avatar's sex.)'

(        Unresolved issues: none)'
()'
(Version update --)'
(    We now have the ability to update the players' object disks remotely.  We)'
(    need a mechanism in the host to use this ability.)'
(        Priority: high to medium)'
(        Who: Janet to implement; Chip to advise \(LFL to provide data\))'
(        Time: unknown; Janet needs more information)'
(        Status: not done)'
(        Unresolved issues: Janet still does not understand how this will work;)'
(                it is unclear whether track/sector update is too blunt an)'
(                instrument)'

(Region specific object sets --)'
(    Mechanism to enable object disks to be swapped, allowing different parts)'
(    of the world to have radically different object sets.)'
(        Priority: low for now, high later)'
(        Who: Randy to implement; Chip and Janet to handle region terrain-type)'
(                transition in host)'
(        Time: 1-3 days)'
(        Status: on hold)'
(        Unresolved issues: disk layout)'

(Music --)'
(    Need music player mechanism and music for the jukebox and tape player)'
(    objects.)'
(        Priority: low)'
(        Who: Randy to implement music driver; Chris to advise; Chris and ? to)'
(                create music \(music creation can be an ongoing activity once)'
(                the mechanism is installed\); Chip to implement behavior code)'
(                to use it)'
(        Time: <1 day for music driver, arbitrary time for composition, 1-2)'
(                days for behaviors)'
(        Status: on the back burner for sure)'
(        Unresolved issues: not relevant)'

(Shouting --)'
(    We figured out an extension to the player interface to allow players to)'
(    talk to adjoining regions by "shouting".)'
(        Priority: low)'
(        Who: Janet needs to add some interprocess stuff in the host to make)'
(                this happen)'
(        Time: <1 day)'
(        Status: not started)'
(        Unresolved issues: none)'

(Grenade timer --)'
(    After some thinking, we finally devised a very clever mechanism to be the)'
(    timer for the hand grenade object.  This needs to be installed in the)'
(    host.)'
(        Priority: low)'
(        Who: Chip to implement in host; Janet to advise on timer-driven)'
(                events in the Stratus; Randy or Aric to supplement in C64 in)'
(                necessary \(probably won't be\))'
(        Time: <1 day)'
(        Status: not done)'
(        Unresolved issues: this is currently an experimental element)'
