(Habitat Completeion Schedule.)'

(us to Beta-3 two days later than the previous schedule, HOWEVER there is)'
(nothing on this schedule beyond beta-3.  In other words, I did away with the)'
(so called "Release" version in name and pulled everything in under Beta-3.  We)'
(end up completing the overall schedule 5 days earlier than previously planned.)'
(This savings is due to several factors.  Primary among these are our being)'

(the solution to task #25 that lets me feel confident in planning to spend)'
(couple fewer days on *it*.)'

(should let us test our end of it regardless of whether Janet gets her part)'
(working.  \(We may want to consider adding a new class of "test" object which)'
(simply exists to get sent arbitrary messages and send back arbitrary)'
(responses.\))'

(Even though this is an extra-super-hyper-crunch-mode schedule, Aric and Randy)'

(appreciate your efforts today \(which is to say, a lot!\).  The rest of the week)'
