(3-Jan-86 1pm. Talked to Marc on phone.  Acknowledged reciept of two fedex)'
(listings of communications software.  Complemented his 6502 programmer on good)'
(code.  Confirmed visit for next week is still on.  Discussed demo needs.)'
(Looks like a 'tape recording' of some line interchange will do just fine.)'
(They are going to install instrumentation on their end to capture such data.)'
(Talked about upgrade distribution.  Looks like on-line stuff will work.  Marc)'
(reiterated that their concern is who pays.)'

(7-Jan-86 all day.  Had meeting with Marc and Janet.  Introduced them to Randy)'
(and showed them balloon-o-matic, discussed communications problems.)'
(Introduced them to Gary and showed them early avatar animation and the cel)'
(editor.  Introduced them to Aric, showed them the animation driver and)'
(discussed animation problems/solutions.  Introduced them to everybody else)'
(\(courtesy and cultural background info\).)'
()'
(Spent morning discussing the big picture: what the components of their system)'
(are and how they interact, what the components of our system will be, how it)'
(all fits together.  One of their concerns is how we balance the load when the)'
(number of users gets large.  What they have to be able to do is spread the)'
(host's job over a bunch of separate computers running concurrently.)'
(Fortunately, our design makes this quite easy.  In fact, it turns out that)'
(they will probably be able to use their existing software that that supports)'
(their room-oriented chat system as the basis for the host database handler.)'
()'
(Took them to lunch at the Ranch.  They were suitably impressed and ooh'ed and)'
(ah'ed at all the right things.)'
()'
(Spent the afternoon discussing who had to do what to get the thing going.)'
(They will do the host remote procedure call object behavior lookup system)'
(\(Looi\).  We will provide the object behavior software routines themselves.)'
(They will do the host-end object database software.  We will specify the)'
(layout of the host database and actually provide the data to go into it.  They)'
(will provide tools for entering this data into their system and for altering)'
(it once it is already there.  We will provide advice on what these tools)'
(should be as part of the database specification.  They will provide routines)'
(so that the object behavior code can get at the contents of the database)'
(easily.  In the process of figuring this all out we redesigned the)'
(communications protocol and the object reference and naming scheme in order to)'
(solve some problems which Marc identified.  The result is greatly superior to)'
(what we had before in every respect.  Lots of ideas were generated and both)'
(Marc and Janet got real excited.  They even started talking about the eventual)'
(need to do "MicroCosm II" \(for fancier machines with faster communications\))'
(someday after MicroCosm is a big hit.)'
()'
(We talked intermittently about the game itself and the MicroCosm fantasy.  We)'
(discussed the avatar and turf customization kits and what sort of interface to)'
(the system they would require.  This lead Marc to raise the question of)'
(whether the players would be able to choose where their turves connect into)'
(the world.  I had thought that the locations were fixed, but letting people)'
(fiddle with them in certain constrained ways enables a number of interesting)'
(things to happen, including a real estate marketplace and the formation of)'
(political alliances based on territoriality.)'
()'
(We discussed asynchronous events that can occur within the system.  From our)'
(point of view, the two most significant are the arrival of mail in the)'
(player's electronic mailbox and the arrival of an on-line message from another)'
(player.  We \(LFL\) need to discuss the extent to which we want to integrate the)'
(communications facilities of the MicroCosm fantasy world \(mail, telephone\))'

(We came up with a list of short-term things for each of us to do.)'

(required, to make a first crack at defining what kinds of low-level routines)'
(will be needed to interact with the database, and to think about interactive)'

(They are going to start setting up the database structure itself based on my)'
(input.  \(They are going to use off-the-shelf database software for the bulk of)'
(it\).  They are also going to start hacking around a version of the "rooming)'
(house" software \(that which handles "rooms" in their chat utility\) to become a)'
("region monitor" module.  Part of this involves figuring out what sorts of)'
(asynchronous events within the system will be needed to make it work.  They)'
(are also going to work on low-level routines for interrogating and updating)'
(the database.  Also, Marc is going to send us information about the Q-Link)'
(load-file format so that we can have our Commodore 64 software load and run)'
(off of disk under Q-Link's control \(i.e., when you select the "MicroCosm" menu)'
(item inside Q-Link\).  This will let me write a filter to make our object files)'

("display" command that doesn't actually display, multiple commands on a line,)'

(under advisement.  Also asked for delete object command and she explained the)'
(way to do this is to move the object to region 98 or 99 \(98=destroyed,)'
(99=limbo\).  We need to add some new fields to the avatar and the region, which)'
(is problematic because those databases are hard to change.  We need a "stun)'
(counter" field in the avatar, but we decided to use the "bus fare paid" flag)'
(since the bus system is dead.  We need a "light level" value in the region,)'

(She suggested each entry on a line: 20 char address, space, region number.)'

(said I would pass along to Randy.  She also asked if we could have the cursor)'

(12 \(you can't ID an avatar if you're holding something\) will be fixed by the)'
(HELP key, which will pick up the ID avatar function in the case where you are)'
(pointing at an avatar; item 13 \(typing long ESP message and getting kicked)'
