(Re: Rob & Janet's item/question memo of 12/7)'
()'
(As you requested, here is an item-by-item status report in response to Rob &)'
(Janet's memo of 12/7/87: \(I've quoted the memo literally on the lines)'
(beginning with ">".\))'
()'
(>Here is a list of all outstanding items we have on record, not including)'
(>three of the four "meta-problems" \(heartbeat/protocol disconnect, PC)'
(>loader, memory hits\) or manifestations of them as near as we can judge.)'
(>The fourth meta-problem, "messages to non-existing noids," we believe to)'
(>be a problem with auto-teleport, which we'll continue to test)'
()'
(The "messages to non-existing noids" problem was indeed in the auto-teleport)'
(routine and is fixed as of 10/30 \(version 6.4\).  Of the other three, the)'
("memory hits" problem turned out to be a bug in the bottle object and was also)'
(fixed as of 10/30 in version 6.4.)'
()'
(>SYSTEM)'
()'
(>Needs testing)'
(>-------------)'
(>Auto-teleport -- dying, some Choke machines, wands)'
(        As mentioned above, this is fixed in version 6.4 as of 10/30 \(ver 6.4)'
(        release notes, 11/10\))'
(>GO/F3 collision \(next rev\))'
(        Fixed in version Beta 1.0 as of 12/9)'
(>Error recovery for disk routines \(next rev\))'
(        Installed in version Beta 1.0 as of 12/9)'
(>FE3 \(JoeyT1\))'
(        Since we do not have a dump disk for this problem, we cannot give a)'
(        100% assured diagnosis.  However, reasoning from the circumstances)'
(        surrounding it, our hypothesis is that it is the same problem as the)'
(        GO/F3 collision bug mentioned above and the FE#13 that RJScott had.)'
(>FE13 \(RJScott\))'
(        This turned out to be a result of the very same problem as the GO/F3)'
(        collision bug, and so is fixed.)'
()'
(>Requires disk change \(status uncertain\))'
(>---------------------------------------)'
(        Almost all of these are host problems or changes, not disk based.)'
()'
(>PUTing to a sitting Avatar makes it stand \(9/10; #62\))'
(        This is a host only bug, fixed as of 11/11)'
(>New entries to regions don't show the state of an avatar)'
(        There was a problem with this once upon a time \(prior to our keeping)'
(        the current bug database\).  We believe it is fixed \(was host bug\).)'
(        There have been no reports of this happening for as far back as our)'
(        database goes.)'
(>Lamps are awfully wide \(9/10; #94 sorta\))'
(        We aren't sure what this means.  If Quantum wants us to change the)'
(        collision detection parameters for the streetlamp we can do so easily.)'
(        If so, it would be a host only change.)'
(>Ticket DO hangs 64 \(9/10; #85\))'
(        Our records show this as being fixed as of 9/2)'
(>Grenade doesn't work \(9/10; #81\))'
(        Working as of 11/11 \(host only change\).)'

(        We decided that the ring is sufficiently different that we don't need)'
(        to mess with changing the image.)'
(>Cursor turned into PUT icon in text interface \(11/4; #500\))'
(        We wrote this one off as a mystery on 10/12.  Lord Bolan \(to whom this)'
(        happened\) had a number of odd things happen to only him, leading us to)'
(        suspect his machine.  We have kept our eyes open for recurrences;)'
(        there haven't been any.)'
(>Command lockout turing GO while able to receive ESP, etc. \(11/4; #374\))'
(        Another weird Lord Bolan thing.)'
(>Blank paper with written graphic state \(9/10; #128\))'
(        Fixed \(on host\) as of 10/12)'
(>Random sign appearances \(12/2; #696\))'
(        Operator boo-boo while using Ghu; accidently moved wrong item.)'
(>Shrunk to smallest size on 'porting home \(12/2; #691\))'
(        Currently on our working bug list.)'
(>Grab from left-hand side doesn't always work \(9/10; #26\))'
(        Confusion resulting from collision detection; not a bug.)'
()'
(>Disk questions)'
(>--------------)'
(>On DOs that include GO, should avatars face cursor on arrival? \(9/10; #64\))'
(        GO is set up so that avatar is always facing in proper direction on)'
(        arrival.  Sometimes this is facing cursor, sometimes not.)'
(>Should all DOs include GOs? \(9/10; #95\))'
(        No.  In many cases the semantics of the DO operation makes this)'
(        impossible.  Where it is possible, we do so.)'
(>Do chairs work easily \(i.e., GO from chair with one push?\))'
(        Yes.)'
(>Does Help work while seated? \(9/10; #31\))'
(        No.  The only thing you can do while seated is talk or GO.  It would)'
(        be nice if you could do HELP while seated, but this would require some)'
(        fairly hairy changes to the command interface routines, so we decided)'
(        not to, in the interest of moving things forward.)'
(>Follow command? \(12/2; #190\))'
(        This has been an on-again/off-again feature.  We need to make a final)'
(        decision as to whether or not to implement this.  Our feeling here is)'
(        that it is probably not needed, and we have the impression that the)'
(        consensus at Quantum is similar; however, we need to decide.  If we do)'
(        decide to implement this, the changes will be entirely host based.)'
(>Does adding the ability to make objects prompt users require disk changes?)'
(>\(9/10; #9\))'
(        Yes, but the changes have already been made.  They were installed in)'
(        version 6.4 and have been tested.)'
()'
(>Host problems)'
(>-------------)'
(>Lights \(both floor and flash/torch\) do not consistently work \(12/2,)'
(>               comments -- 9/2, #96, #109 -- 11/4, #305\))'
(        They should work now.  There were a couple of weird interacting host)'
(        software problems, the last of which was fixed 11/19, as well as a)'
(        systematic error in the database which was corrected on 12/4)'
(>Cloning & prices on vendos -- are we sure they're right?)'
(        We did a thorough check on all vendo prices and they are all correct.)'
(>Title page/index for books \(12/2; #104\))'
(        It was the Book of Records in particular that required the index)'
(        \(which needed to be generated by the program that generates that)'
(        particular document\).  Janet implemented this as of 12/8.)'
(>Finish 'port, town and region help names for regions \(10/12; #9\))'
(        \(Actually item #194\).  Port and town help arrows are in as of 11/19;)'
(        we currently have the testers hunting for the inevitable mistakes.)'

(        Our records show this being fixed as of 9/3.)'

(        Our records show this being fixed as of 9/3.)'

(        We think we should, but a decision needs to be made.  If we do it,)'
(        Janet is the one who will have to implement it.)'
(>Add a type field to 'crats to allow customized responses \(9/10; #202\))'
(        Upon reflection we concluded that this was unnecessary.)'
(>Put apartment tape online and test \(10/12; #11\))'
(        Final rev. of apartement installed on 12/9.  Requires Beta 1.0)'
(        software to work properly \(there was a bug in the elevator\).)'
(>Change all countertops to...something else \(10/12; #82\))'
(        As of 11/11 all countertops work just like tables.)'
(>Two mail in pocket messages for one piece of mail \(10/12; #222\))'
(        Fixed as of 10/30 \(host change by Janet\).)'
()'
(>Manual changes)'
(>--------------)'
(>Revise to be current with Beta Release)'
(        Version of manual sent 12/7 accurately describes Beta 1.0 system.)'
(>Include graphic symbols/CTRL keys)'
(>Index)'
(        These can be added.  We'll need to redesign the page layout however,)'
(        since these will add a few pages.)'
(>Is there a current map of downtown?)'
(        Yes, but not in a distributable form.)'
(>Should we explain how tables, bookcases and dressers are containers?)'
(        I don't know.  Should we?)'
(>Should Jan gather as much as we know about configuration requirements?)'
(        This would probably be wise.)'
(>A little clearer about 'port booths, mebbe)'
(        We will take a look at it.  What in particular needs clarification?)'
()'
(>Ghu)'
(>---)'
(>QL Rep \(Rob\) proficient enought to implement basic programming \(10/12\))'
(        Rob is the judge of this.)'
(>Are there any docs on the macro language?)'
(        Yes.  The document we sent to Quantum describes the macro features)'
(        fully.)'
(>Make Oracle fully functional & accessible)'
(>Can GHU handle Oracle requests?)'
(        Oracle handling is now implemented in Ghu.  We will send a revised)'
(        edition of the manual that describes the relevent commands.)'
(>Can GHU hand Rant publishing?)'
(        Yes.  Text handling features are now implemented.  These will also be)'
(        described in the new edition of the manual.)'

(        Yes.  However, we would like to consult with Quantum about what)'
(        protection features are required, if any, to prevent unauthorized)'
(        mangling of the database or invasions of privacy accomplished via Ghu.)'
(>Can \(does?\) GHU show memory usage in a region?)'
(        No.)'
(>Loops)'
(        The version of Ghu originally released to Quantum had a looping)'
(        feature.  We have since made this feature somewhat more general and)'
(        this improvement is described in the latest edition of the manual.)'
(>Can I search for items of a specific class?)'
(        Yes, but it is very inefficient, since it requires iterating through)'
(        the entire database.  If we were to make the class field a database)'
(        key then we could do this more efficiently.  Janet?)'

(>Capture the Flag)'
(        We are awaiting a chance to test this on a limited scale before)'
