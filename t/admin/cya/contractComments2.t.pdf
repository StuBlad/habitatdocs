(Here are my comments on the latest rev of the Quantum contract.  In the)'
(interest of a timely response I will not attempt to categorize them, but)'
(simply give them in the order they occur in the document.)'
()'
(Section 1.1 -- change "objective" to "object".)'
()'
(Section 1.9 -- is a Commodore 128 version a "conversion"?  It shouldn't be but)'
(this paragraph implies that it is.)'
()'
(Section 1.16 -- is "Beta-Test" now a sufficiently well established legal term)'
(that we don't have to say what it means?)'
()'
(Section 5.11 -- "...it [Quantum] will not allow Subscribers to use MicroCosm)'
(on a free, no-charge or reduced-charge basis for any reason."  They should be)'
(allowed to give away or discount use insofar as we agree to let them, because)'
(testors, administrators, "Geek Gods", and the like will in all probability be)'
(user volunteers whose only compensation is free use of the system.  To the)'
(extent that we will want such people, Quantum should be allowed to give them)'
(freebies \(within the limits we specify, e.g., no more than so many Gods, etc.\))'
()'
(Section 7.3 -- in the phrase "...1 hour per month usage for every 4)'
(subscribers...", it is unclear whether we are referring to Q-Link subscribers)'
(or just to MicroCosm subscribers -- I presume we mean the former, but since)'
(the two are not exactly the same \(since you have to get extra software to use)'
(MicroCosm\) we should be explicit.)'
()'
(Section 9.3 -- good!  Very important.  Don't let this paragraph slip away.)'
()'
(Section 14.6 -- I have no complaints.  I just curious how you got them to go)'
(along with this...)'
()'
(Section 16.1 -- Is "bugs" a legitimate legal term?)'
()'
(Section 22.1 -- Forgive my naivete', but how could we incur any bodily or)'
(personal injury or property damage liability as a result of this product???)'
(\(I understand about CYA; I'm just curious.\))'
()'
(Exhibit B -- Please check to verify that this corresponds to the milestones)'
(document I gave Steve.  My printout has the formatting all funny so it's hard)'
(for me to check.  However, I do note one thing missing, the delivery of the)'
(C64 communications software from Quantum to us ASAP.)'
()'
(Exhibit C -- Where is exhibit C?)'
()'
(In general -- Looks real good.  Roberta, do they give you special glasses in)'
(law school so you don't go cross eyed reading this stuff?  I'm impressed.)'
