(I spoke with Marc and Anne right after lunch.  Got my questions answered ok)'
(and went over my current setup plan with them.  We agree on most everything.)'
()'
(Marc wants to stress to the demonstrators what they are allowed to do rather)'
(than what they are not allowed to do -- i.e., prescribe rather than proscribe.)'
(I will be changing the tone of the plan document a little bit to reflect this)'
(idea.)'
()'
(Physical setup is as we expected, 8 stations grouped into 4 pairs.  Anne says)'
(they can put the 2 pairs that are out on the dance floor back-to-back but that)'
(this will be problem for the other two stations.  I suggested that we should)'
(have a Stratus terminal or a voice line to Virginia in a back room somewhere.)'
(Anne said this was a problem because we only have 8 phone lines, which had to)'
(be set up special.  Marc, however, saw the value in this suggestion and)'
(recommends that we keep one of demo stations near a curtain where we can pull)'
(it down and use its phone line to call Virginia if we have to.)'
()'
(They are planning on having 4 people online from Virginia, not the 8 that I)'
(had guessed, though Marc said they could add more if we wanted them to.  It's)'
(no big deal to me \(my choice of 8 was arbitrary\) so we are going to plan on)'
(the basis of 4.  One of the 4 will be Ken Huntsman, who will be standing by in)'
(Virginia as the experienced hand in case of problems.)'
()'
(Anne stressed that their years of experience giving demos has taught them to)'
(expect glitches and crashes due to telephone problems, so we should just be)'
(cool and not worry too much if something dies -- we should just be prepared to)'
(drop back and restart.)'
()'
(They agreed that they are responsible for technical logistics but that we are)'
(responsible for the content of the demo.)'

(The Habitat gang all got together today and spent a few hours discussing)'

(We are going on the expectation that I am going to continue to be preoccupied)'

(to be any, and that I will also be responsible for overseeing the Beta-test)'
(\(the assumption being that the Beta test will result in sudden, massive)'

(of world generation is going to fall primarily to Randy and Aric, though I)'
(will supervise.  On the basis of these assumptions, came up with the following)'
(division of task responsibilities for the next couple of weeks:)'
