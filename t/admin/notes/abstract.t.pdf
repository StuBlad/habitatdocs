(Habitat -)'
()'
(The foresight to integrate the support and software tools from the beginning,)'
(including bringing FastLink up, has been invaluable.  Without this support we)'
(would not have been able to keep any sort of schedule.  The high-level tools)'
(have been long levers.  The rapport among the group has been very good and)'
(ideas and programming from each person has been encouraged. )'
()'
(Early on in the project a lot of design work was done and legal delays on the)'
(contract provided time to develop the design further. This planning time)'
(worked out well and paid off as we decided exactly what we wanted to do. )'
()'
(Because of the concentration on the software design the creative content)'
(suffered and the world was not ready.  Since nothing like this had ever been)'
(attempted before a lot of problems and details we didn't expect arose and)'
(caused delays and scheduling problems.)'
()'
(The biggest problem is the distance we are from Quantum.  Because of the)'
(difference in time zones, corporate culture, and work habits the interfacing)'
(is not as good as it could have been.  The few face to face meetings that were)'
(held were very helpful and went well.  More frequent and intense contact would)'
(have made things much easier and helped to avoid the various misunderstandings)'
(which cropped up.  Since Nancy has formalized the communication procedure)'
(things are better.  We should have scheduled more time to understand and)'
(program the host computer since it turned out not to be a very clean system.)'
()'
(Planning & Pacing - In general, the more thought, the better prepared you will)'
(be for unforeseen work.  Since lots of crunch work is inevitable the schedule)'
(should plan the crunches throughout rather than simply allowing them to)'
(dominate at the end.  What the designer doesn't know or anticipate effects the)'
(schedule \(usually for the worse\) and although the design and implementation)'
(are related they are not always clearly separable.)'
()'
(As much time as possible should be spent planning, and everything should be)'
(planned in more detail, even if you take this principle inot account.  The)'
(underlying system needs to be built to be creatively flexible because things)'
(are guaranteed to change later on when you have a clearer idea of what you are)'
(doing.  Because the creative and technical parts of the design are)'
(interrelated, both need to be planned together.  If this had been done better)'
(with Habitat it would have resulted in a better time estimate.  Instead we)'
(tried to create a set of building blocks without a completely clear idea of)'
(what we were going to build with them.)'
()'
(Every task which involved the Q-Link host computer was a problem because we)'
(initially didn't understand their system, its system protocol or the assets)'
(which we could use. )'
()'
(Conflicts -)'
()'
(Quantum did not think in the same way we did of systems for enabling users to)'
(communicate with each other and so various conflicts in design came up that)'
(had to be dealt with.  It came down to whether we were doing a)'
(telecommunications game using their existing ideas or creating a new one.  Our)'
(idea was to do more of a fantasy world separate from the rest of the user's)'
(life and Quantum had difficulty understanding this.  In particular, they have)'
(never understood the principle of witholding capabilities from players for)'
(dramatic or creative purposes -- they tend to want people to have access to)'
(the maximum possible set of capabilities at all times, regardless of)'
(situation.)'
