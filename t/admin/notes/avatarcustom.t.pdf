(Avatar customization bytes:)'
(        The data returned by the customizer on the C64 consists of the)'
(following:)'
()'
(        <head style> <head pattern> <orientation> <custom1> <custom2>)'
()'
(NOTE: in the interest of clarity, I've renamed these slightly from the names)'
(given in the previous document describing the new user customizer.  The)'
(content has not changed however.)'
()'
(        <head style> goes into the Style variable of the head.  It should be a)'
(number in the range 1 to N, where N is the number of heads available)'
(\(currently N is 63 and growing daily\).)'
()'
(        <head pattern> goes into the Orientation variable of the head, and)'
(determines the color/pattern of the hair.  Its form is:)'
()'
(                xPPPPxxx)'
()'
(where PPPP is a four-bit number \(i.e., 0 to 15\) that indicates what pattern to)'
(use.  Pattern 15 is allowed but discouraged as it chooses the color-ram color)'
(which varies with screen position.  The 'x' bits are the other bits of the)'
(orientation and shouldn't be messed with.  When creating a new avatar it is)'
(sufficient to set these to 0.  In any case the byte passed back by the)'
(customizer can be stuffed wholesale into the head's orientation.)'
()'
(These bytes are properties of a head object which should be created and)'
(contained in the HEAD containership slot of the avatar \(slot 2 counting from)'
(0\).)'
()'
(        <orientation> goes into the Orientation variable of the avatar, and)'
(determines a number of things.  Its form is:)'
()'
(                SHHHHxxx)'
()'
(where the S bit determines sex \(0==male, 1==female\), and the four bit number)'
(HHHH determines height \(0 is tallest, 15 is shortest\).  As with the head)'
(orientation, the xxx bits should not be touched in operation but can be set to)'
(zero on initialization, and the byte returned by the customizer on the C64 can)'
(be used wholesale.)'
()'
(        <custom1> goes into the Customize\(1\) variable of the avatar, and)'
(determines leg and torso patterns.  Its form is)'
()'
(                LLLLTTTT)'
()'
(where LLLL is the leg pattern \(in the range 0-15\) and TTTT is the torso)'
(pattern \(also in the range 0-15\).  The selection of patterns is the same as)'
(with hair.)'
()'
(        <custom2> goes into the Customize\(2\) variable of the avatar, and)'
(determines arm pattern.  Its form is)'
()'
(                AAAA0000)'
()'
(where AAAA is the arm pattern \(in the range 0-15\).  The remaining four bits)'
(are not used at this time.  The selection of patterns is also the same as)'
(hair, legs, and torso.)'
