(Dial up the local Telenet node, enter 3 carriage returns and then \(at the '@')'
(prompt\) enter '70339l' \(that's an "L", not a "1"\).)'

(Our login is 'chip'.  Password is 'lunch'.)'

(To login type)'
(        login chip -module m1)'

(Directory structure:)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas)'
(        Our home directory.  The only interesting thing here is the)'
(        'abbreviations' file.  Update this at your peril.)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas>microcosm)'
(        The master directory for OUR source code on the Stratus.  The alias)'
(        'work' will cd you to this directory from anywhere in the system.)'
()'
(        EVERYTHING that is ours should be compiled from this directory, even)'
(        though the source is in one of its subdirectories \(otherwise the)'
(        include files won't work -- bunch of include files that are used)'
(        everywhere are to be found here\).)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas>microcosm>Actions)'
(        Sources for the generic action code.  A bunch of files of the form)'
(        'actions_something.pl1'.  These are all included in a single master)'
(        file named 'actions.pl1'.)'
()'
(        To recompile, use the command 'pl1 Actions>actions' from the master)'
(        directory.)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas>microcosm>Classes)'
(        Sources for the class behavior code.  There is one file for each)'
(        class, named 'class_something.pl1'.  To recompile, use the command)'
(        'pl1 Classes>class_something' *or* 'plc something' from the master)'
(        directory.)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas>microcosm>Structs)'
(        Sources for struct definition include files used everywhere.  There is)'
(        one such file for each class names 'struct_something.incl.pl1' plus a)'
(        bunch of additional ones that are used in various places.  You don't)'
(        need to compile these, they are source included.)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas>microcosm>Misc)'
(        Sources for miscellaneous routines used in out code.  There are three)'
(        files, 'helpers.pl1', 'bits.pl1' and 'messages.pl1'.)'
()'
(        'helpers.pl1' is the bulk of the miscellaneous routines.  Basically,)'
(        anything of ours that is not elsewhere is here \(of course\).)'
()'
(        'bits.pl1' is all the bit-twiddling routines that PL/1 doesn't let)'
(        you do nicely.)'
()'
(        'messages.pl1' is all the message I/O routines for the behavior code.)'
()'
(        Compile this stuff with 'pl1 Misc>whatever' from the master directory.)'

(%cvideo#d010>lucas>microcosm>Linkable)'
(        The linkable object modules \('.obj' files\) for ALL of our stuff.)'
(        Whenever you recompile some things \(from the master directory always\),)'
(        you should enter the command 'mv *.obj Linkable', otherwise changes)'
(        will not get picked up by a rebind.)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>lucas>toolbox)'
(        Contains a bunch of utilities we've written.  The alias 'cdtool' takes)'
(        you here from anywhere.)'
()'
(        In particular, this directory contains OUR version of Twiddle, so)'
(        always 'cdtool' before running twiddle, otherwise it may not know)'
(        about some of the newer classes.)'
()'
(%cvideo#d010>quantum>stratus>source>microcosm)'
(        Source and object files for the regionproc and the like.  The alias)'
(        'cdbind' takes you to this directory.  There is an abbreviation for)'
(        this directory name, 'bindir', that can be used in command arguments)'
(        at any time.)'
()'
(        You can recompile the regionproc from this directory with the command)'
(        'pl1 regionproc'.  You don't need to do anything with the '.obj' file)'
(        after recompiling regionproc.)'
()'
(        This directory also contains the stuff we need to update twiddle when)'
(        we add a new class.  There is a file 'init_twiddle.pl1' here.  Here)'
(        you will also find 'init_twiddle.doc' and 'twiddle.doc' which tell you)'
(        how to upgrade twiddle and how to use twiddle, respectively.  If you)'
(        update 'init_twiddle.pl1' according to these instructions, you then)'
(        need to enter the following commands \(in order, from this directory\):)'
(                pl1 init_twiddle)'
(                bind twiddle init_twiddle)'
(                cdtool)'

()'
(%cvideo#d010>quantum>run_lucas)'
(        The "run directory".  The alias 'cdrun' will take you here.  There is)'
(        also an abbreviation for this directory name, 'rundir', that can be)'
(        used in command arguments.)'
()'
(        This is where you do a reset from.  The command 'reset' \(which will)'
(        only work from this directory\) will reset Habitat.)'
()'
(        The log file also lives here.  It is named 'log.log'.)'
()'
(        Also in this directory are the commands 'stop_monitor' and)'
(        'start_monitor' which, respectively, bring down and put back up the)'
(        Q-Link test system.  Be careful that ALL processes \(except your login)'
(        process, of course\) are dead before doing a 'start_monitor'.  They)'
(        don't stop instantaneously when you do a 'stop_monitor'.  )'
()'
(        You can leave "mail" for Janet by putting messages in files here with)'
(        names like 'note_to_janet_47' \(do an 'ls' first to pick the next)'
(        number in the sequence\).  Janet also leaves mail for us here, in files)'
(        with names like 'note_to_chip_23'.  The alias 'mail' will check for)'
(        these files from anywhere.  You just have to remember what the most)'
(        recent one was, as it doesn't just show you the new messages...)'
()'
(Other useful command aliases we have created:)'
(        'fixup' will rebind the regionproc, install it AND reset.  Can be)'

(        'redo' will rebind and reinstall but WON'T reset.  This is useful for)'
(                making a new version while you are still testing an old one.)'
(        'rebind' will rebind.  Only works from 'bindir'.  Not useful unless)'

(                always pipes ALL terminal output through something like the)'
(                unix 'more' command, which is usually very irritating\).)'
(        'grep' approximates the unix grep command.)'
(        'alias' greps through the abbreviations file, in case you forgot a)'
(                command or a directory name.)'
(        'edit filename' invokes the awful Stratus line editor.  There is a)'
(                copy of the Stratus commands manual \(which explains the line)'
(                editor\) on my desk.)'
