(                A quick guide to the Habitat source code)'
()'
(There are five major chunks of code:)'
()'
(        Actions -- the action code for the various objects)'
(        Main -- main loop, common storage declaration, common macros)'
(        Io -- telecommunications, keyboard, sound, screen driver, etc.)'
(        Heap -- disk database and object memory manager)'
(        Gr -- graphics rendering and animation sequencing)'
()'
(The files within each of these groups have been printed alphabetically.  The)'
(last four groups get linked into the main program.  The first \(Actions\) goes)'
(onto the object database disk.  The object database disk also includes the)'
(sound and image definitions.  Though there is source for these, I have not)'
(included it since it consists simply of byte data declaration statements, and)'
(the bulk of this code exceeds that of the rest of the source code by nearly a)'
(factor of two.)'
()'
(Included with the Actions code is the file 'beta.mud', which is the control)'
(file that generates the object disk database.  This is input to our utility)'
('muddle', which generates the object database files from the sound, image and)'
(action binaries.  The format should be relatively self-explanatory.  Muddle)'
(also generates the widely used include file 'class_equates.m'.)'
()'
(I've also thrown in the Makefile which shows how all the pieces fit together.)'
()'
(Our assembler is a little unusual, and since we make heavy use of its macro)'
(capabilities, I've also included a copy of the assembler writeup.)'
