(DANGER! That is the one thing that seems)'
(to be totally missing from Habitat. The)'
(only way to get hurt is through fellow)'
(Avatars which, of course, causes hard)'
(feelings among the people running the)'
(Avatars. There should be natural dangers)'
(both living and non-living, random and)'
(set, out in the wilderness.)'

(MANY!)'
(1. More movement of items such as water.)'
(2. More selection of wardrobe color.)'
(3. An occasional street that one would)'
(   seem to be "walking down" affording)'
(   a view of BOTH sides of the street)'
(   at the same time.)'
(4. Options for selecting one's own)'
(   "turf" and furnishings to suit one's)'
(   personal tastes.)'
(5. Elimination of the momentary "bounce)'
(   back" of the cursor after selection.)'
(6. Ability to have more than one item)'
(   in one's hand.  Example: You're)'
(   walking down a street and spot a)'
(   TOKEN lying on the street.  Now it)'
(   requires a PUT if you're carrying)'
(   something, then a GET.  Another who)'
(   isn't carrying something would have)'
(   the edge over the other.  If I had)'
(   three bags of groceries in my arms in)'
(   real life, you can bet I'd STILL)'
(   reach down for that $10. bill on the)'
(   street AND get it!)'
(7. A "LIE" position.  Just for a change)'
(   of what can be done, and to indicate)'
(   boredom or disinterest with another's)'
(   antics.)'
(8. Window dressings in the "turfs".)'
(9. The ability to manipulate one's)'
(   "turf" property..that is, to plant)'
(   flowers, dig, etc, within the)'
(   confines of one's property.)'

(10. Selective colors for shoes. Pink)'
(   is fine for women, but not for men.)'
(11. An expanded vocabulary for The)'
(   Oracle. Ex: If I were to ask "him")'
(   about the "weather" - the string)'
(   "weather" would be part of his)'
(   response.)'

(:)'
(12. More things to DO! Currently, while)'
( Habitat is innovative, unless there are)'
( more "system supplied" things to do, I)'
( think the new member will tire of it)'
( quickly.)'
(13. "Eraseable" SYSTEM MESSAGES. Unlike)'
( a conversation, which SHOULD follow you)'
( from screen to screen \(i.e., ESP\) a)'
( SYSTEM MESSAGE will cause that ESP to)'
( scroll off the screen.  If a SYSMSG)'
( could "overlap" the ESP, and be F5'd)'
( OFF, the ESP would remain.)'
(14. Inclusion of more realistic)'
( landscapes...rattlers in the desert)'
( with an occasional prairie dog, or)'
( birds in the sky \(yes, moving\) and)'
( butterflies in the woods...or an)'
( occasional "woodsy inhabitant" to be)'
( encountered would add greatly to the)'
( eye appeal of the product.)'
(15. Racial Avatars: I'm sure that those)'
( of the black or oriental heritage)'
( would avail themselves of their)'
( particular race if permitted to do)'
( so, and it would add interest to the)'
( game if it duplicated "real life" in)'
( that area.)'
(16. The acceptance of input time seems)'
( to be rather slow.  I don't know if it)'
( can be speeded up, but those of us who)'
( type quickly are encountered with a)'
( series of "boings" when inputting too)'
( rapidly.)'
(:)'
(Please read the input in the manner I)'
(intend...constructive.  And thanks for)'
(the opportunity for me to input.)'
