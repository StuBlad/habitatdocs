(I like the ability to create my own)'
(character - that being the loveable but)'
(ornery old "HabiHermit" who talks when)'
(he feels like it, and hates ESP.)'
(:)'
(Travelling around picking up bits and)'
(scraps and taking them to the Pawn Shop)'
(have been noted by others on the system,)'
(and "RJScott" has gotten a reputation)'
(for doing so.)'
(:)'
(Also, the ability to complain to the)'
(Editor of the RANT, and seeing one's)'
(complaints published is a treat. One can)'
(say pretty much what one wants to and)'
(not risk offending anyone else, since)'
(we're dealing with "created characters")'
(rather than the real personality.)'
(:)'
(A recent example of this was when I)'
(requested a citizen's arrest of the)'
(sheriff's wife, Becky, for failure to)'
(remove Pre-Election promotions and)'
(requests for votes. All parties accepted)'
(that in good humor.)'

(Mail From:  John Apple)'
( I would say the best thing I like about)'
(Habitat is that it helps to make people,)'
(er Avatars, more human! Actually seeing)'
(a representation of the person you are)'
(talking to helps to make that person mor)'
(more real, if you know what I mean. The)'
(other thing I like about Habitat was the)'
(exploration of new areas. I think adding)'
(more areas to explore and find things)'
(would be a great advantage to the game.)'
(Also testing things to see what they do)'
(is fun. The "change machine" and the "Do)'
(Not Press This Button" were FUN!  :\))'
