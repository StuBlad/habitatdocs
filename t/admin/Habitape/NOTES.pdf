(I have looked into the list of missing files that you sent to Randy.  Here is)'
(the story:)'
()'
(Some of the files are QuantumLink proprietary, and I can't give them to you \(I)'
(can't even read them myself any more\).  They relate to aspects of the)'
(QuantumLink system itself, not to Habitat, so the fact that you don't have them)'
(should not prove to be a problem.)'
()'
(Some of the files are PL/1 "include" files.  The Stratus PL/1 compiler enforces)'
(the convention that all include files have names that end in ".incl.pl1".  It)'
(will add this extension to any include name that doesn't already have it.  Thus)'
(if you see the line)'
()'
(        %include 'foo';)'
()'
(in one place and then)'
()'
(        %include 'foo.incl.pl1';)'
()'
(in another, they refer to the same file.  Several of the files on the list fall)'
(into this category, where you thought you were missing the 'foo' file, but you)'
(actually have the 'foo.incl.pl1' file on the original tape.)'
()'
(Some of the files are ones that we gave you listings for but were not on the)'
(tape because they were simply example that we did not think you would need them)'
(in machine-readable form.  However, if you want them, you've got them.)'
()'
(Finally, some files were really missing.)'
()'
(As you requested, I will have a tape for you at our meeting at Skywalker on)'
(November 10.)'
()'
(Here is the complete run down on a file-by-file basis \(taken from your list\):)'

(#1: A couple of files are quite obsolete.  Nothing in them is ever referred to)'
(by the software, and references to them may be safely deleted.)'
()'
(#2: Janet rearranged some of the files on the host between the time we printed)'
(out the listing and the time the original tape was made.  Several of the class)'
(files were incorporated into a single file, with the previously)'
(separately-compiled files being included in a single compilation unit.)'
(However, there are no structural differences between the contents of the source)'
(files in the two different versions.)'
()'
(#3: We can find no reference to a file called 'parser.incl.pl1' in any of our)'
(files nor can anyone remember there ever being such a file.  Perhaps this is a)'
(mistake?)'
()'
(#4: 'y.tab.incl.pl1' is simply a definition file generated by the Unix 'yacc')'
(utility from 'ghu.ply', after massaging by our Emacs macros.  See the Unix)'
(documentation on 'yacc' for the description of the file 'y.tab.h'.)'
