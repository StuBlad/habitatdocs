(            The teleport was invented by the great)'

(        many years to perfect the technique, and many)'
(        a test animal was lost to the void. It is still)'
(        rumored to this day that, when the conditions)'
(        are JUST RIGHT when teleporting, an avatar)'
(        may end up with animal parts in place of his normal)'
(        limbs and/or head. Rest assured that this is)'
(        ONLY a rumor.)'
(        Reguardless of the rumored risks, the teleport)'
(        has become the single most valued addition to)'
(        the universe, opening whole vista's of places)'
(        to explore. Socially the 'Port', as it is called)'
(        by most everyone, was to restructure the world)'
(        forever. THANK YOU Foontrafian!)'
