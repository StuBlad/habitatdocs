(SUBJ: Theft)'
(FROM: Celebrindl  08/30/87   S#: 105859)'
(The big question.... or is it?)'
()'
(I seem to recall reading somewhere that Habitat is a GAME, folks. \(It's even)'
(called the Game Disk 3.\))'
()'
(Earlier today -or last night, I misremember which- Cornelius got bumped just)'
(after setting down a gun. He left, the gun stayed. Being a consciencious)'
(Avatar, I picked up his litter...and being a poor Avatar, I sold it for the)'
(money.)'
()'
(Since that time, I have gotten a lot of SH_T from Cornelius and Osgood about)'
(returning the gun or money. Including one cryptic letter: "You have a lot to)'
(learn.")'
()'
(Now, it is my interpretation that theft is part of the game...there is even a)'
(list of the "best" \(or most active\) thieves in Habitat. So why do I feel that)'
(my mortal soul is in danger?  I was warned that "you don't know who you're)'
(dealing with. Check his ID." \(So what, I have a Vienna ID on a few names,)'
(too..d. the most it means to me is that Cornelius is Inhouse staff.\))'
()'
(I also don't recall seeing any signs saying "There are Avatars who are also)'
(GOD. Do not mess with them, or else!" We are all equal in Habitat.. more or)'
(less.. I have had everything stolen from me but my tokens.. and I, in turn,)'
(and taken a few things from others. Not ONCE did I say "you don't know who)'
(you're dealing with." I usually just swore good-naturedly \(offscreen\)..)'
(attempted to retrieve the item..  failed.. and went onward.)'
()'
(There is a certain amount of trust in this game.. sure.. but it is a GAME! We)'
(are testing it.. true.. but it is a GAME!)'
()'
(If Cornelius and Osgood can't handle good-natured "handling" \(as a kender)'
(would say\).. they'd better watch out..  because I'm not alone. \(I say 9 names)'
(on that Thieves' board.. the 10th was MANY AVATARS!\) I am not alone.. and I)'
(doubt I have commited any original atrocities.. \(give me time.. I'm still)'
(new.\))'
()'
(I cold say much more on this subject..  but I'll leave space for responses..)'
(for I really wish to see what others think on this.. do I deserve cancellation)'
(for pawning someone else's gun? Do I deserve HARASSMENT for it?  \(Yes, I used)'
(that term on purpose..  since it's much a violation of Terms.\) Please help us)'
(decide.)'

(FROM: Bonnie      08/30/87   S#: 122417)'
(..someone tried to steal my box and I didn't think it was fun.)'

(This IS a game..but why the need to steal? Just because someone took something)'
(that belonged to you is not a reason for you to behave that way. Two wrongs)'
