(Subject: hal's comments, a reminder)'
(Hal suggested the following:)'
(1.  "Hide a thing".... have someone find it and re-hide it somewhere in)'
(the Universe.  Have them leave a clue.  Finding it is important, and)'
(records are kept, announcements made, etc.  This is a trans-realm game.)'
(2.  Automatons.  Like Big Game Hunting, only hunting snipes or something.)'
(They try to keep away from avatars.  Catching one is a big deal, as they)'
(are somewhat mysterious.  Loch Ness Monster and Abominable Snowman.  Maybe)'
(they leave tracks or something.)'
(3.  Special gates that only allow certain kinds of people in... eg. ones)'
(with fly heads or something.  Maybe not made absolutely clear what the)'
(criteria are before you get there, to keep the mystery up.)'
(4.  Parts/Puzzle.  Like Legos.  Gather the parts to build a thing \(like)'
(an H-Bomb\).  Find out if people build the bomb and blow up the world,)'
(or destroy the parts so no one else can.... A little morality play.)'
