(I've examined the development contract to figure out what dangling obligations)'
(there may still be.  According to the list of milestones and deliverables,)'
(here is how we stand:)'
()'
(For May 15, we were to deliver "full system beta-test version: C64 disk with)'
(home system object, preliminary user and system documentation".  I think that)'
(there is no question but what we have met this.)'
()'
(For June 15, we were to deliver a debugged system, "full system revised)'
(version with debugged C64 home system disk, modified user documentation",)'
(i.e., an improved version of the software with documentation updated to match.)'
(My interpretation of the intent of this deliverable was to provide an)'
(intermediate version in between the initial beta-test disk and the final disk.)'
(We were also to provide "Rev. 1" object code for Avatar and Turf customization)'
(kits.  The Avatar customization package is installed and working.  Turf)'
(customization has been incorporated into the regular system design, rather)'
(than as a separate software package; however, the software for Turf)'
(customization is installed and working.  Since we have been providing them)'
(software and documentation updates continuously, I think we have met this one)'
(too.)'
()'
(For July 15, we were to deliver "full system delivery: C64 disk with home)'
(system object code, final rev. of host system \(Q\), final user documentation")'
(\(the parenthetical "Q" says that Quantum was to provide the final host)'
(system\).  Implied but not explicitly stated is that the C64 software here is)'
(to be the final \(release\) rev.  We have not delivered anything that we have)'
(declared to be "the final version".  I think the present version is very close)'
(to final, but I won't bet that beta testing won't turn up a few more minor)'
(bugs.  The intent was that there would be beta-test feedback upon which to)'
(base the final version, but since beta-test has not begun due to the host)'
(being unready, we have no such feedback.  To the extent that we have)'
(up-to-date feedback from Quantum, the present version of the C64 software is)'
(complete.  We can make an argument that we have met this one.  The)'
(successfulness of such an argument will depend upon your persuasive ability.)'
()'
(For August 15, we were to deliver "final system operation documents, reports".)'
(I am currently preparing operation documents, which should be ready in rough)'
(form within a day or two.  Final reports will not be appropriate until there)'
(is something final to report on.)'

(That's the way it is...)'
