(                        Remaining Habitat tasks)'
(                        -----------------------)'
(        What follows is intended to be an exhaustive list of the remaing)'
(implementation tasks in the Habitat project.  They are listed in very rough)'
(order of priority, ranked in groups from most important to least important.)'
()'
(Generate the world --)'
(    Immense ongoing task to make the Habitat an interesting place to visit.)'
(        Priority: very high)'
(        Who: everyone)'
(        Time: open ended, needs planning for immediate next stages)'
(        Status: first piece of world is almost ready, various other pieces in)'
(                various other states of design/implementation)'
()'
(Teleport network --)'
(    Basic long-distance random-access transportation system.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Janet to implement teleport number lookup mechanism in host; Chip)'
(                and Randy to test and debug related object behaviors)'
(        Time: less than 1 week?)'
(        Status: C64 components all work, though they haven't been tested in)'
(                concert as there is no way to do this; host object behaviors)'
(                are all written, but untested due to lack of number lookup)'
(                mechanism; everything awaits the teleport number database and)'
(                associated access routines)'
()'
(More heads --)'
(    We would like to have 100 or more different possible avatar heads by)'
(    release time.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Aric to coordinate; Gary and others to generate artwork)'
(        Time: variable and ongoing)'
(        Status: 20 heads and counting)'
()'
(Sex change device --)'
(    Aric has added sex to avatar torsos.  We need a device to let players)'
(    choose their avatar's sex.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Chip to implement object; Aric to handle graphics)'
(        Time: 1/2 day)'
(        Status: undone, but trivial)'
()'
(Version update --)'
(    We now have the ability to update the players' object disks remotely.  We)'
(    need a mechanism in the host to use this ability.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Janet to implement; Chip to advise)'
(        Time: a few days)'
(        Status: not done)'
()'
(Avatar death --)'
(    In theory, avatars can be killed in combat.  We still need to define a)'
(    plausable combat resolution mechanism and to implement the actions that)'
(    take place when an avatar actually dies.  This includes defining what)'
(    reincarnation REALLY means.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Chip to design, in consultation with everyone else; Chip and)'
(                Janet to implement in host)'
(        Time: several days)'
(        Status: not done)'

(Sound effects --)'
(    All the objects need appropriate sound effects.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Chris to create sounds; Chip and Randy to integrate with objects)'
(        Time: a week or so for sounds to be finished, a day or two to)'
(                integrate and test)'
(        Status: roughly 60% of sounds are done, others are progressing nicely)'
()'
(Q-3 upgrade --)'
(    Make it work with the latest rev of the Q-Link software.)'
(        Priority: high)'
(        Who: Randy to advise Quantum; various Quantum folk to implement)'
(        Time: negligable)'
(        Status: should just work, but hasn't been tried)'

(Collision detect/adjacency check in host --)'
(    Routines in host to make sure avatars don't walk through things, etc.)'

(        Time: unknown)'
(        Status: not done)'
()'
(Capacity handling --)'
(    We want the host to be able to keep track of how much memory the players')'
(    C64s have left, so that it can decide whether there is room for new)'
(    objects to appear or not.  This requires that the host have a database of)'
(    the class information on the C64 object disk \(it can't just keep a size)'
(    number for each object since objects can share overlapping resources\).)'
(        Priority: medium to high)'
(        Who: Janet and Chip to implement; Chip to provide the data)'
(        Time: 1 week)'
(        Status: this is a hairy pain in the you-know-where; in particular, it)'
(                is unclear how this information will be stored in the host)'
(                \(i.e., in memory or on disk\); fortunately, it is not urgent,)'
(                as other, simpler strategies can be used to satisfice in the)'
(                meantime)'

(Hole and shovel objects --)'
(    These are a couple of objects useful for Randy's initial adventure)'
(    scenario, among other things.)'
(        Priority: medium to high)'
(        Who: Randy to implement C64 behavior; Chip to implement host behavior)'
(        Time: less than 1 day)'
(        Status: C64 behaviors basically written, needs integration with host)'
(                and definition of objects in host database.)'
()'
(LRU memory reclamation --)'
(    A more clever algorithm to determine which old data to throw away when)'
(    more memory is needed in the C64.)'

(        Status: not started; a lot of work to debug)'
()'
(Oracle --)'
(    The host end of the oracle needs to be implemented.  The oracle takes a)'
(    number of forms, most notably the fountain and the genie in the magic)'
(    lamp.)'
(        Priority: medium to high)'

(        Time: unknown)'

(                communicate directly through the oracle and for things said to)'
(                oracles to be logged for future attention)'
()'
(Hall of records --)'
(    The hall of records will probably wind up being a book of records instead,)'
(    but in any case the records to be kept need to be defined and the)'
(    mechanisms to collect the information required to keep them up to date and)'
(    the database required to store them must both be implemented.)'
(        Priority: medium to high)'
(        Who: Chip to decide on records to be kept, in consultation with the)'
(                rest of the crew; Janet to implement record collecting and)'
(                storage facilities on host; Chip to assist in host)'

(        Status: not done)'
()'
(New user signup --)'
(    When a new user signs up to play, several things need to be done: he needs)'
(    to pick a name \(for mailing purposes, if nothing else\) and a sex, he needs)'
(    to be assigned a turf, his avatar needs to be generated and any other)'
(    worldly goods generated and placed.  This all happens in the host, though)'
(    some sort of dialog at the Q-Link level is probably best for getting the)'
(    name and sex choices.)'
(        Priority: medium to high)'
(        Who: Janet and other \(unknown\) Quantum folk to implement)'
(        Time: unknown)'
(        Status: not done)'
()'
(God --)'
(    Various tools are required to give the host-based operators control over)'
(    the goings on in the world.  The C64 already has a means of arbitrarily)'
(    creating and deleting objects on command from the host, though we still)'
(    want to add a way to arbitrarily fiddle with an object's state from the)'
(    host.  We also need to implement the hand-of-god object on the C64 to)'
(    allow operators to zap things dramatically.  The host needs a set of)'
(    routines to command these various capabilities, and some sort of)'
(    interactive utility to allow the operators to monitor the activity in any)'
(    region and to invoke the special command routines.)'
(        Priority: high to low, depending on the piece in question)'
(        Who: Randy to implement the state twiddler behavior; Aric and Randy to)'
(                implement the hand-of-god in the C64; Janet and Chip to create)'
(                the command routines; Janet to implement the region monitoring)'
(                routines; unknown Quantum people to implement the)'
(                interactive operator utility)'
(        Time: a few hours for the state twiddler, a 1-2 days for the)'
(                hand-of-god, 1-2 days for the command routines, an unknown)'
(                amount of time for the other host-based facilities)'
