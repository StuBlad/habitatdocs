(Subject: wish list)'
(Status: RO)'
()'
(Here's a baker's dozen of ideas that Jo and I think would be improvements)'
(to Habitat, for your consideration:)'
()'
()'
(1.  The penalty for dying is too severe.  I don't mind having my avatar get)'
(killed, as long as it's only an inconvenience -- but when I get penalized)'
(for getting killed, it's a drag.  We'd like to see it be like in cartoons,)'
(where the character who just got killed walks back from his turf and punches)'
(out the guy who killed him... and nothing else has changed.)'
()'
(2.  There should be a wider range of facial expressions.  We think a dozen)'
(expressions would just about cover the standard range that people would be)'
(most likely to wish for.  The storage cost should be negligible.)'
()'
(3.  In the same vein, each special \(i.e. non-standard\) head should have)'
(one special gesture or animation that it can do, that no other head can do.)'
(The propellor beanie is a good example.  All non-standard heads should have)'
(this capability.  If a particular head isn't different enough to merit a)'
(unique animation, you should consider dropping it from the database.)'
()'
(4.  We'd really like to be able to teleport anywhere -- even places where)'
(there isn't any teleport.  If the region is too full to accept you, it should)'
(simply tell you so and not allow you to teleport \(this problem may occur even)'
(in standard teleport regions, so I don't see why it should be any different\).)'
()'
(5.  An even more powerful option:  a magic device that teleports you to)'
(wherever another avatar is, by name.  "Take Me To SPBlives!"  ::bamf::)'
()'
(6.  A matched pair of portable holes.  You can pick them up and carry them)'
(around, but whenever they're BOTH laying on the ground, you can walk through)'
(from one to the other, both ways.  Could be a great plot device.)'
()'
(7.  How about a little suitcase that you buy for an exorbitant price \(say,)'
(50,000 tokens\), carry to a suitable region, set down and DO -- and a house)'
(appears.  It's your turf, you paid for it, and you can just walk in and)'
(set up housekeeping.  When you get finished laughing, think about how much)'
(it would simplify the process of creating new cities.)'
()'
(8.  A pocket-sized door that you can buy in a vending machine, place against)'
(a wall in your house, and DO -- and add an adjoining room.  It should only)'
(work in your own turf, of course.)'
()'
(9.  A magic wand that turns an avatar into a tree.  He remains in that form)'
(as long as the avatar who changed him stays in the same region with him.)'
(DOing it again reverses the transformation.  The transformed avatar can't)'
(walk around, so he can't pick things up unless he already happens to be)'
(positioned correctly, but he can talk, write letters, take things out of his)'
(pocket, and DO them.  Making the magic user remain in the same region ensures)'
(that he will get out of it reasonably soon, or if not, that at least he'll)'
(have someone to talk to, because the other guy won't be going anywhere either.)'

(In the worst case, it should be automatically cancelled when the system goes)'
(down at the end of the day.  This is necessary in the event anyone is foolish)'
(\(or clumsy\) enough to use the wand on himself, and someone else just happens)'
(to steal it before he can change himself back.)'
()'
(10.  A universal "Dispel Magic" amulet that reverses or cancels any spell,)'
(including the one above.  Given the existence of such a device, it might be)'
(possible to make certain wands or devices like the above even more powerful,)'
(because there would always be an easy \(albeit expensive\) way to undo them.)'
(Possessors of such amulets would always be in great demand.)'
()'
(11.  A secret decoder ring that scrambles your speech -- and unscrambles)'
(others' speech.  Two \(or more\) people standing in the same region holding)'
(identical rings would be able to talk to each other, but no one else would)'
(be able to understand them.  Great for secret Habitat guild meetings.)'
()'
(12.  A way to know that someone is in the region next to where you are.)'
(It would make the world seem a lot bigger, and a whole lot more connected.)'
()'
(13.  A way to know who else is in Habitat, or at least in the city or area)'
(that you're in.  Specific locations aren't necessary, but it would be really)'
(nice just to know that you're not alone.)'
