(From chip Fri Apr 24 17:45:10 1987)'
(Received: by moth; 24 APR 87 17:45:10 PST)'
(From: chip \(Chip Morningstar -- "Software Without Moving Parts"\))'
(To: aric, chip, farmer, nancy, sda)'
(Subject: Today's summary report)'
(Status: R)'
()'
(Here is the task summary for Friday, April 24.)'
()'
(I have incorporated Randy's summary of the ARF's for the past few days')'
(testing.  For the sake of having an unambiguous reference scheme, I have gone)'
(and numbered all the outstanding past items with 'x' numbers \(#x1 through)'
(#x55\).  Following Randy's convention, the items from the 4/14-4/15 fax memo)'
(are numbered #1 through #30, while ARF items will now be numbered)'
(consecutively from #100 \(top item is currently #116\).)'
()'
(This will be a little confusing for a while until we get the summary report)'
(format straight between us.  Randy: let's discuss this.)'
()'
(Also, to some of the items \(notably #12, #113 and #114\) I have added)'
(parenthetical comments in square brackets [like this].  Y'all should take)'
(notice of these, because we need to make some decisions.)'
()'
(Format: Left-hand column is priority/release requirement \('A' = alpha, 'B' =)'
(beta, 'R' = release, '-' = usable as done, '+' = strictly wishlist item\).)'
(Next column to the right is status: 'D' = done, 'T' = testing, 'W' = working)'
(on it, ' ' = pending, 'I' = just an idea right now.  Next comes the initials)'
(of the people responsible for the item, then the item tag number, and finally)'
(the item itself.)'
()'
