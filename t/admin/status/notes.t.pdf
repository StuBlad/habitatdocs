(Subject: The scoop on Telenet)'
(Status: R)'
()'
(As y'all know, we were visited this morning by Carol Brown and Tom Cramer from)'
(Telenet.  They gave Randy and I the detailed scoop on their service and they)'
(left me with a bunch of literature.  The bottom line is that it's pretty)'
(expensive, but there are a lot of options to explore.  The price comes in)'
(several pieces:)'
()'
(I. Accounting charge)'
(        $140/month independent of the number of connections or volume of use.)'
()'
(II. "DAF" \(Dedicated Access Facility\).)'
(        This is the physical connection to their system.  Included in this is)'
(a dedicated leased line to their San Francisco node, all the wiring into our)'
(plant, modems on both ends of the line, and dedicated access to a port on)'
(their node.  The price varies somewhat with the bandwidth of the connection.)'
(For our purposes the best price/performance tradeoff seems to be at around)'
(9600 baud.  Cost for this is a one-time installation charge of $1200 plus)'
($1524/month.)'
()'
(III. Traffic charges)'
(        These are billed in units that they call "segments".  A segment is)'
(a chunk of up to 64 bytes of transmitted data.  These cost $1.40 per thousand)'
(\(i.e., $1.40 for each 64K bytes of data sent\).  There is a 50% discount for)'
(use during non-prime-time hours \(ie., after 6pm\).  This cost is)'
(distance-independent -- i.e., it doesn't matter how far you are sending the)'
(data.)'
()'
(IV. Dial-in charges)'
(        If we choose to allow dial-in to our system through Telenet, there is)'
(a per-minute charge that varies according to the type of node that you are)'
(connected to.  They classify their nodes 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending on the)'
(level of traffic.  'A' nodes are found in big cities like San Francisco or)'
(Washington, D.C..  'B' nodes are places like Palo Alto or Buffalo.  'C' nodes)'
(are places like San Rafael or Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  Charge varies from around)'
($5.25/hour for an 'A' node to around $12.50/hour for a 'C' node.  As with)'
(traffic charges, there is a 50% rakeoff for off-hours use.)'
()'
(In addition, we would need to have an X.25 interface on one of our Suns or)'
(Vaxes here.  I'm not sure about the cost, but my guess is that it would be in)'
(the $1000 to $3000 range.  Also, we would still need to obtain some sort of)'
(file transfer protocol software to communicate data with Quanum, since our)'
(computers and theirs have incompatible operating systems.  A call to Sun is)'
(probably in order if we want to pursue this further.)'
()'
(These prices appear to be prohibitive if we were to install such a connection)'
(exclusively for the benefit of Habitat \(at least until Habitat becomes a MUCH)'
(bigger deal\).  However, there may be additional ways to justify the cost.  For)'
(example, it appears that the company could save about 80% on Telex costs by)'
(hooking to CCI through Telenet rather than by phone.  This is certainly not)'
(enough by itself to recover the cost of the Telenet connection, but it's an)'
(example of the sort of thing we can look for.  The Telenet sales people were)'
(real gung-ho on other uses of their services, such as connecting directly to)'

(Griddle is now working.  It can read "griddle", "raw" or contents vector files)'

(simply LOST, since the C64 does not keep all the state information that the)'
(host keeps.  Furthermore, once the divergence between the host-form and the)'
(C64-form has happened, there is no way, given the present system, to get back)'
(the lost information and merge it with any changes that might have been made)'
(using Reno \(we can and do set the lost field values to their defaults, but)'
(this is often incorrect\).)'

(What we need is something analagous to the the Sun frontend for FACE -- a)'
(program that would keep track of what you are editing and hold the host-only)'
(information until you are done.  This program would represent everything on)'
(the Sun end in griddle or raw format.  The contents vector format would become)'
