(Game Structure)'
()'
(        Games would be played in the afformentioned phases, with three)'
(        very general types of play \(irregardless of theme\):)'
()'
(        1.  "Automatic" games where the player sets up some high level)'
(            goals or "doctrines", E.G. a military doctrine of shoot first,)'
(            ask questions later, an exploration doctrine of send in a few)'
(            military, and if unopposed send in civilians, otherwise more)'
(            military.  Updates will take care of actual movement and)'
(            interactions.  ROBOTWAR is an example of this kind of game,)'
(            although with only one round.  Political multiplayer team)'
(            games with each player being a cabinet minister \(or co-dictator\))'
(            and setting up a doctrine independently, then submitting them)'
(            together and playing several teams against each other are)'
(            another possibility.  You could win as a team, or as an)'
(            individual \(based on what the computer-generated populace)'
(            thought of your policies\).)'
()'
(        2.  "Semi-Automatic", which can range from automatic games with)'
(            a few special orders that can effect the database without)'
(            an update, through games with internal economics and politics)'
(            under your control, but with interactions between players)'
(            happening only at updates and according to preplanned doctrines,)'
(            to games like Flying Buffalo's STARWEB, with almost everything)'
(            being ordered explicitly, and only a few special situations)'
(            \(ambush, retreats, conditional attacks\) being mediated by)'
(            the computer during update.  An example of this sort of game)'
(            would be one of interstellar exploration.  Each player would)'
(            have real-time control over their home planet, building and)'
(            exploring their home system, sending out colony ships and)'
(            explorers and warships on missions.  If the stars in this)'
(            world are a minimum of four light years apart, the updates)'
(            would take place every four years.  At that time any new)'
(            missions would be transferred between players' computers,)'
(            with the computers keeping the information secret until the)'
(            time that ships arrive at the opponent's home planets, probably)'
(            during the off-line phase.  These missions would be controlled)'
(            by the computer, according to whatever doctrine the player)'
(            sending the ship out had determined at time of launch.  Speed)'
(            of light would limit communications as well as transport - if)'
(            an explorer went to a system 6 lightyears away, it would take)'
(            12 years \(game years of course\) to find out if there were any)'
(            planets there.  Once a colony has been established and reaches)'
(            a certain technology level, they can build an ansible, an)'
(            instantaneous communications device that works only between)'
(            planets.  Then the colony would be controlled by the player)'
(            when offline, and new doctrines could be established instantly.)'
(            Changing technology would make a great difference in this game,)'
(            and situations like Haldeman's "The Forever War" would easily)'
(            happen.)'
()'
(        3.  "Manual" games, where the game mechanics are simple and players)'
(            can proceed with full control over what happens, exchanging)'

(            information at updates but resolving attacks, building, etc.)'
(            independently.  An example of this sort of game is SLAG, by)'
(            Stewart Eastman for the TRS-80.  This game started 2-12 players)'
(            with identical forces consisting of industry, bombers, ICBM's,)'
(            ABM's, Subs, Sub missiles, Anti-sub planes, and a spy network.)'
(            Each turn the players decide what to build with their indust-)'
(            rial output \(any of the forces mentioned except spys\), and)'
(            whether to move their spy network to a different country.)'
(            Then they decide whether to launch an attack, and what forces)'
(            to use.  Sub missile attacks are not identified by country.)'
(            Bomber attacks take two turns to complete, and can be called)'
(            off on the second turn \(keeping the bomber circling over)'
(            enemy countries\).  ICBM attacks come through in one turn,)'
(            so bomber attacks must be launched the turn before to)'
(            co-ordinate.  After the build/attack phase, an update would)'
(            occur.  Before seeing industrial output for that turn, the)'
(            players would find out if they were under attack that turn,)'
(            and attempt to fight it off if they were.  This is done in)'
(            an arcade style game with missiles and bombers passing overhead)'
(            and ABM's being used to shoot them down.  Bombers hit only once)'
(            will drop their bombs and crash.  Hit twice, they are destroyed)'
(            before attacking.  Missiles must only be hit once.  ICBM and)'
(            Bomber attacks identify the attacking country, sub missile attacks)'
(            do not.  If the player survives the attack phase with any industry)'
(            the player's ASW planes can try to spot subs, and go into an)'
(            arcade game for that phase, sub against plane.  Then another)'
(            build phase, started off with a spy report from the country your)'
(            spy network is in.   This game was lots of fun as a single)'
(            computer game with many players taking turns, and would go faster)'
(            with multiple computers.  Similar game play with an original)'
(            game is of course possible.)'
