(                database programmer goes away; one of the two C64 programmers)'

(                comments below under "Ramp down"\))'
(     Sep  2 - *Now* are we rich yet?)'
()'
(Yes, I realize that the schedule gets more and more vague as time passes.)'
()'
(Ramp down -- Programming effort will make a gradual transition from)'
(development to maintenance during the period from June to September 1, 1986.)'
(This schedule does not take into account possible future work.  Such work can)'
(come in several forms:)'
()'
(        - enhancement of C64 user interface \(low probability\))'
()'
(        - adaptation of home system to other machines \(Amiga, Atari, Apple\),)'
(                probably with enhancements that take advantage of those)'
(                machines' greater capabilities \(high probability assuming the)'
(                base system is successful\))'
()'
(        - expansion of the universe itself)'
()'
(The latter development can itself come in several flavors.  The three most)'
(notable are:)'
()'
(        - addition of new elements by Lucasfilm \(i.e., more objects, more)'
(                object capabilities, new and better graphics and imagery, more)'
(                places to go/things to do in the world\))'
()'
(        - addition of new elements by third parties \(the same as the previous)'
(                item in ultimate effect but very different in terms of the)'
(                work organization and business arrangements\))'
()'
(        - addition of gateways from the universe into otherwise unrelated)'
(                software & systems which are provided by third parties \(the)'
(                basic mechanism to do this will be built into the system, and)'
(                we will quite possibly have some such attachments in place)'
(                when we first go on the air\))'
()'
(By September 1, 1986, the process of adding elements to the universe should be)'
(fairly cut-and-dried.  We will have developed tools to do all the hard parts,)'
(since the technical side of this will be largely a matter of internal)'
(book-keeping.  Addition of elements will then be primarily an artistic and)'

(design problem, as it rightfully should be.  One consideration that will be)'
(important will, of course, be system load, since each new element consumes)'
(disk and memory space and potentially can soak up CPU time.  If the system is)'
(a success, in time we will have to consider measures to expand its capacity)'
(beyond the limits planned for by Q-Link.  I do not know at what point this)'
(would happen.)'
()'
(Using the MicroCosm as a bridge between the user and other systems will be)'
(somewhat more complex, but should be as well understood by the time we hand)'
(the system off to full-time manager types.)'
()'
(Availability of the system \(and associated tools\) to third-party developers)'
(can happen anytime between February 1 and the end of the project.  Of course,)'
(the later it happens, the more stable the environment they will have to work)'

(Computers:)'
()'
(        We'll need C64s for everyone with the usual complement of disk drives,)'
(monitors, etc.  They will all also require modems with which to talk to)'
(Q-Link.  The modems will then need phone lines.)'
()'
(        I presume that Q-Link will provide the host computer and any)'
(associated hardware that is required on their end, that being their business)'
(and all.)'
()'
(        We will also need development host machines on our end of the sort we)'
(use now: Suns and the Vax.  2 Suns plus the Vax would be ideal.  We'll need)'
(these machines to run Macross on, to program the C64.  We'll need them for)'
(text editing & documentation too.  Also, I intend to produce a set of)'
(development software tools for the definition of the components of the)'
(universe.  These will largely be very simple preprocessors that will output C)'
(or PL/I code to run on the Q-Link host.  In all likelihood these tools will be)'
(run on our machines to produce output that will be run on their machines.)'
()'
(        Some tool for Gary to create graphic imagery for the C64 will also be)'
(needed.  The presently available tools are crude but workable.  It appears)'
(that the stuff we already use with the Atari may be adaptable for these)'
(purposes.  Gary says we can use the Atari screen editor without alteration)'
(even though the images created will be going onto the C64.  I'm thinking of)'
(using an adaptation of Charlie's cel animation driver to render the avatars,)'
(and Gary swears he won't use ACE again until some additional capabilities are)'
(added to it.  I will have to confer with Charlie to see how much work these)'
(additional capabilities will require and whether we can get him to do it.)'
()'
(        I am presently making heavy use of Ron's Macintosh for architectural)'
(and conceptual diagrams.  This will continue.  We currently have Macintosh)'
(Smalltalk-80 on order from Apple.  I hope to be able to use this to prototype)'
(bits and pieces of the object interactions needed to model the contents of the)'
(universe.  However, Smalltalk needs a 512K Mac to run, so at present I'll have)'
(to steal time on Levine's or Steve's Mac during the evenings when they're not)'
(around.  It may prove desirable to add a fat Mac for my desk to the shopping)'

(Communications:)'
()'

(electronic mail service.  We won't \(I suppose\) have to pay for use of their)'
(system, but we may have to pay for time on the packet-switching communications)'
(network through which our computers will call them.  Possibly Q-Link will just)'
(absorb this expense.  The business types can figure that out.  We may want to)'
(look into some sort of interface so that our electronic mail system can talk)'
(to theirs.  I don't have any idea how doable this might be.  The existing UUCP)'
(software is so fancy it may already have the hooks needed, but I'm not the)'
(expert on that.  We will also undoubtedly end up spending a small fortune on)'
(long-distance telephone calls.)'
()'
(        Also, it seems inevitable that there will have to be some travel)'
(betwixt here and there, both us visiting them and them visiting us.  I don't)'
(know how much such travel there will be for sure, but figuring on one or two)'
(people making monthly trips in each direction would probably be a good minimum)'
(guesstimate.)'
()'
(        Depending upon the level of participation of third-party software)'
(vendors either as providers of additional universe elements or as clients)'
(using MicroCosm as an access mechanism to sell their product, additional)'
(travel may be required.  This will depend upon who they are, where they are,)'
(and how many of them there are, none of which we know.  I suspect that)'
(third-party participation will be minimal in the beginning phases, but after)'
(we open up for beta-test it's anybody's guess.)'
()'
(Miscellaneous:)'

(        The usual overhead to cover the cost of light bulbs, thumbtacks,)'
(paperclips, ball-point pens, lawyers, printer paper and other trivial but)'
(necessary items will no doubt apply.)'

(chauvinists and get some Coca-Cola in here for these guys?  How do you expect)'
(people to program under these conditions?)'
()'
(        Undoubtedly there are other things, but I can't think of any.  It's)'
