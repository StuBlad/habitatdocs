()'
(Purpose of demonstration:)'

(        Show off objects \(variety, portability, containership...\))'
(        Show off Regions \(variety\))'
(        Show off Telecommunications \(multiple players, shared host\))'
(        Show off potential for game play)'
()'
(Possible demonstration:)'
()'
(        Begin with avatar at home...)'
()'
(Scene:  Inside of avatar home. Surroundings include; fishtank,)'
(        answering machine, avatar, chair, window.  Answering machine)'
(        is blinking indicating that it has a message.)'
()'
(Action: Avatar can move things around the house and then later moves to)'
(        answering machine and gets message that FRIENDX is coming over.)'

(        atm on the way to the arcade.)'
()'
(Scene:  Next region over.  Contains convenient teleport booth, fire hydrant,)'
(        trees.)'
()'
(Action: Avatars walk to teleport booth and ZAP tm. to side of bank. \(we could)'
(        set destination choice with function keys to get us to any region)'
(        desired!\))'
()'
(Scene:  Outside of Bank.  Brick wall in back and ATM attached to wall.)'
()'
(Action  Avatar performs correct mumbo jumbo and Tokens arrive.  Avatars are)'
(        now ready to go to the arcade.)'

(Scene:  Inside of Cave.  Dark background with Rocks on floor and stalagtites)'
(        hanging from roof.  A locked treasure chest lies on the floor here.)'
()'
(Action: Use target gun to shoot Rocks, Stalagtite, Treasure chest.  When)'
(        the chest is opened \(there should also be a key around somewhere\))'
(        a gem will be found inside.  Avatars should decide who gets the gem.)'
()'
(        This is a preliminary layout for a possible demonstration, but many)'
(new objects need to be added in order to give us a larger range of possible)'
(actions.  I think that using a scripting system in important in order to)'
(view all of the possible variations that we can present.)'
